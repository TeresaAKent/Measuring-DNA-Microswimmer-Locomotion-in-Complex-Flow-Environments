# Measuring-DNA-Microswimmer-Locomotion-in-Complex-Flow-Environments

Abstractâ€” Microswimmers are sub-millimeter swimming
robots that show potential as a platform for controllable
locomotion in applications including targeted cargo delivery
and minimally invasive surgery. To be viable for these target
applications, microswimmers will eventually need to be able to
navigate in environments with dynamic fluid flows and forces.
Experimental studies with microswimmers towards this goal
are currently rare because of the difficulty isolating intentional
microswimmer locomotion from environment-induced motion.
In this work, we present a method for measuring microswimmer
locomotion within a complex flow environment using fiducial
microspheres. By tracking the particle motion of ferromag-
netic and non-magnetic polystyrene fiducial microspheres, we
capture the effect of fluid flow and magnetic field gradients on
microswimmer trajectories. We then determine the field-driven
translation of these microswimmers relative to fluid flow and
demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by illustrating the
motion of multiple microswimmers through different flows.
